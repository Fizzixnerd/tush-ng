** TODO
*** Quoted paths ('[/hello there/with spaces/])
*** ADTs (sums, products, recursive)
*** Pattern matching
*** Vectors
*** Make Vector and Text work with unbound-generics
*** Path polymorphism (typeclasses?)
*** Interface (use brick)
**** REPL, etc.

** In Progress
*** Tests
*** Std library
**** Currently implementing primitives
**** Wrap ALL THE COMMANDS!

** DONE
*** Evaluator (use unbound-generics)
*** Recursive `let`
    Saying this is done is a little rich. There are at least two bugs. In `step
    (Let binds) = do ...` there is a line `newbody' <- step newBody`. This is
    broken since step returns done then it just won't eval anything. In the
    typechecker, every unknown variable is just given a fresh TVar. Even if they
    appear more than once, and are incompatible, each appearance gets a fresh
    TVar.
